## Company-Employee-Manager Web App

This project is a simple web application built with vanilla JavaScript (HTML, CSS, and JS) that allows company management to create and manage a database of employees.

### Features:

**Employee Management:**

* Add new employees (regular or managers)

* Complex but user-friendly form for adding employee details

**Internal Database:**

* Employees are stored in a local JavaScript object (ideal for initial learning)

* Lays the foundation for working with remote databases and APIs in future projects

### Benefits:

**Practice Makes Perfect:**

* Served as an excellent learning exercise for HTML, CSS, JavaScript

* Helped solidify concepts of form creation, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a local database

**Foundation for Growth:**

* This project provides a stepping stone for working with remote databases and APIs for more complex applications

### Note:

* This is an early project and likely uses a simplified internal database (local JavaScript object).

* It is intended for learning purposes and is not suitable for production use.

### Looking Back:

This project was a fun and rewarding experience that helped me gain valuable skills in web development. It provided a solid foundation for working with more sophisticated database interactions in future projects.
